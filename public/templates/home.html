            <h2>NEED AN APP OR A WEBSITE?</h2>
              <p>Of course you do. It doesn’t matter if you’re a budding entrepreneur or an established business; a photographer, actor or model; real estate agent or doctor; a freelancer or an agency. Maybe you even have an idea for the next billion-dollar app. Whatever your situation, if you want to make money in 2017, you need a modern-looking, functional, state-of-the-art online platform and you need it done right.</p>
            <h2>WHO CAN YOU TRUST WITH YOUR APP OR WEBSITE?</h2>
              <p>The main problem is that there are so many options out there that you are left wondering who to trust. We hate to break it to you, but you have good reason to be scared of the options. In fact, <strong style="color:#FB4F14">New Old Road</strong> was started to counter the frustration our friends were having trying to get a quality online presence built. </p>
              <p>We realized that working with web developers was often a minefield of problems that ranged from overpromising freelancers, outsourced teams that couldn’t understand the vision and were impossible to communicate with, and large development firms that were more concerned with being done with you and your product in order to move onto the next one than catering to your individual needs.</p> 
              <p>Let’s put it to you this way: If you need a 15-point car tune-up, would you go to a window tinting shop? If you need open-heart surgery, would you go to a chiropractor on the other side of the world where there are communication barriers? Would you go to Macy’s for a custom suit? This is essentially what smart business people do when they waste months of their time and thousands of dollars working with these many different types of web developers.</p>
            <h2>WHAT MAKES NEW OLD ROAD DIFFERENT?</h2>
              <p>The difference with <strong style="color:#FB4F14">New Old Road</strong> is that we were once in your shoes and we understand your problem. We are an in-house team of experienced designers, coders, programmers and web developers with defined roles and skill sets that complement each other. This means that you don’t have to rely on one person to do everything. The difference is that our main focus is exceptional communication so we can understand your vision. This is the key component to designing the product according to your specifications to ensure that you get exactly the app or website you want. The difference is that we are an intimate studio who cares about our clients and wants to make sure you are happy instead of worrying about the next ten projects we have lined up.</p>
              <p> With locations in Los Angeles, California and Tel Aviv, Israel, two of the fastest-growing tech hubs in the world, we are easily accessible to not only the sun but more importantly to you. We are willing to meet with you face-to-face or through video to prove that we're not just great at what we do, we're easy to talk to and get along with as well.

                <h2>About Us</h2>
              </div>
              <br>
                <p><strong style="color:#FB4F14">New Old Road</strong> is an in-house team of experienced designers, web developers and marketers based in Los Angeles, California and Tel Aviv, Israel. While we enjoy making websites and web apps of all kind, we specialize in native mobile on-demand application development for Apple iOS through the App Store and Android through the Google Play Store. </p>
                <p>On-demand apps are often characterized as the “Uber or Airbnb for ‘blank’.” This means that most of the products we build use payment systems. These are the types of apps that users need and actually desire to engage with in order to obtain a service by entering their credit cards. This takes the question of “how will we monetize?” out of the equation. </p> 
                <p>We are also open to hearing about your idea for a social application and have selectively chosen to work on such products, but one of our main concerns is ensuring that our clients will be able to make a considerable return on their investment. On-demand apps fill a specific need for the consumer and make life easier. </p>
                <p>At <strong style="color:#FB4F14">New Old Road</strong>, we are passionate about design; specifically User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Design. While functionality is obviously our top priority, we also know that users are well trained to judge their experience within the first few seconds of interacting with the platform. The myth that one can build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and that users will continue to use the product after they have downloaded it has all but been debunked. This is because users are savvy and expect the desktop and mobile products they use to not only work perfectly, but also look great and be fun to use. The idea that functionality comes first and design can come later can be likened to someone starting a car company with a Ferrari engine, but the body of a pinto. The truth of the matter is that functionality and UI/UX Design go hand in hand. <strong style="color:#FB4F14">New Old Road</strong> is committed to building apps that people will not only download, but will want to continue to interact with in the long term.  <br>
